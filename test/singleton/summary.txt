Summary 
    1. Try to avoid singletons.
    2. If you are developing dart,flutter package/plugin then It is OK to create singletons
       for example FirebaseAuth is a singleton class from firebase_auth plugin
    3. If you are developing flutter app then it's always good to use dependency injection
       so that Test cases can be implemented
